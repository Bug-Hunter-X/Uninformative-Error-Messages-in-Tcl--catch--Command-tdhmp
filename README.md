This repository contains a simple Tcl script that showcases a common error handling issue and its improved solution. The original script uses the 'catch' command to handle errors but provides a generic error message. The improved version provides a more descriptive error message that includes the cause of the error, improving debugging and troubleshooting.  The example involves a division by zero, but the concept applies to any type of error.
